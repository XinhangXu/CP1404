A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of *Place to Visit*.


# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
Half and a week. 
At first I try to code all in my style.
However, I found it seems to be wrong, then I delete all and changed the structure that format teacher's requirement.

...  
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. 
See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
In fact the interface is really ugly, but the functions are more satisfied.
All the requirements of functions are met.
...

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
The GUI is ugly, I need to learn more about Kivy.
In the last week there are some many assignments to work on. I decided to spend more time in functions and classes rather than interface.
...

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
All the required functions work well. Though GUI is ugly.
...

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Next time I will improve GUI, not only concentrated on program functions.
A beautiful interface is also important.
...

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
Most of resources are from github and given by lecturer. 
Other relevant materials I ask from classmate or search on internet.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenges for me is GUI, beacuse I do not know how to build GUI by Kivy which is totally by code.
It is more difficult than use SceneBuilder in Java.
At first I ask a lot of questions with my friends. And learn from their code. Then I understand gradually. And work on my code.
...

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
...
It improve me a lot by using classes. Because it allows the structure of my code to be more clear and easy to understand.
By doing this assignment, the skills of using classes are improved as well as my code became more formated.
